      "It began as a fun school project where we were assigned the task of looping through an array of objects representing all the countries in the world. The goal was to display these countries in cards and provide the ability to filter them by continent. As time went on, I decided to enhance the project further. I introduced SVG manipulation, allowing users to clearly visualize the continent they've clicked on.",
